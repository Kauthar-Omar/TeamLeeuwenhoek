## :wave: Welcome to **Team Leeuwenhoek** at the **HackBio 2021 Internship**.

The HackBio internship is a virtual practice oriented program that helps its participants to build their bioinformatics knowledge under mentorship in a 5 week program with 5 stages while collaborating with fellow participants from all over the world.
In addition to the technical skills to be gained the internship is also to improve participants soft skills such as networking among others that would contribute to their growth as scientific researchers.

## The team.

Our team comprises of students, researchers and professionals from different fields with the aim of perfecting their bioinformatics skills by the end of the internship.
We are working together as a team in order to execute this week's task.
The task can be found [here](Task.md) together with the **programming languages** and **dependancies** required executed in.

Meet the team:
