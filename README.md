# TeamLeeuwenhoek
The Repo is to document work done in Team Leeuwenhoek.
Different time zones, different minds, but with a single goal that is to excel.


:wave: Welcome to **Team Leeuwenhoek** at the **HackBio 2021 Intership**.

The HackBio internship is a virtual practice oriented program that helps its participants to build their bioinformatics knowledge under mentorship in a 5 week program with 5 stages while collaborating with fellow participants from all over the world.
In addition to the technical skills to be gained the internship is also to improve participants soft skills such as networkingamong others that would contribute to their growth as scientific researchers.

## The team.

Our team comprises of students, researchers and professionals from different fields with the aim of perfecting their bioinformatics skills by the end of the internship.
We are working together as a team in order to execute this weeks task.
