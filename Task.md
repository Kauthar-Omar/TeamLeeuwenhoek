The following is the task executed in the repo:

The Spreadsheet project
Each team should create a GitHub repo.
- Add a comprehensive readme.md with essential information about the internship, the team, the contributors, pictures if possible using markdown.
- Each team will work on a minimum of  7 different programming languages
For each person in a team, pick one of the 7 programming languages, Write a script that prints your name, your email, your slack username (with @) and your biostack in that order.
- Push the script to your team’s git repo
- Collaboratively as a team, develop a bash script that clones the git repo, and generates a CSV file from all the outputs of your team’s scripts
- Submit your team’s GitHub link to only the bash script
- Only the emails and slack handles that are on the CSV sheet generated by your script will be promoted to stage 1
- To the already exisiting code output, add an extra output that prints out your twitter handle (with @)
- Now, in another column output, calculate the output of the Hamming distance between your slack handle and twitter handle.
- The output for every team member should now be name, email, slack_username (with @) your biostack , twitter_handle and hamming_distance.
